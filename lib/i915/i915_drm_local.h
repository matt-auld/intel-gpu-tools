 * Signal to the kernel that the object will need to be accessed via

 * Only valid when placing objects in I915_MEMORY_CLASS_DEVICE, and only
 * strictly required on platforms where only some of the device memory
 * is directly visible or mappable through the CPU, like on DG2+.
 *
 * One of the placements MUST also be I915_MEMORY_CLASS_SYSTEM, to
 * ensure we can always spill the allocation to system memory, if we
 * can't place the object in the mappable part of
 * I915_MEMORY_CLASS_DEVICE.
 *
 * Without this hint, the kernel will assume that non-mappable
 * I915_MEMORY_CLASS_DEVICE is preferred for this object. Note that the
 * kernel can still migrate the object to the mappable part, as a last
 * resort, if userspace ever CPU faults this object, but this might be
 * expensive, and so ideally should be avoided.
